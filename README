I implement the Gamal-Goldwasser-Micali pseudorandom function (prf) family in C++ with the Salsa20 stream cipher as the pseudorandom number generator (prng) used in the prf. salsa20.h implements the Salsa20 stream cipher, ggm.h implements the Gamal-Goldwasser-Micali prf using Salsa20 as the prng, and test.cpp provides examples of using the GGM implementation.
The Salsa20 implementation is based on the cipher specification found at https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/spec.pdf. The GGM implementation is based on content learned in cryptography classes. The purpose of this implementation is to enforce my knowledge of applied cryptographic primitives, specifically the prf primitive.
